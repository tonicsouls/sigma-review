        "SCENARIO": "Disinfection is powerful, but it doesn't kill everything. For tools that are meant to puncture skin, we need the ultimate weapon, a method that ensures 100% destruction of all microbial life.",

        "THE_LAW": "The law defines 'Sterilization' as the destruction of all microbial life, including highly resistant bacterial spores. This is most often achieved with an Autoclave (steam under pressure) or a Dry Heat sterilizer. Simply soaking a tool in disinfectant is not sterilization."
