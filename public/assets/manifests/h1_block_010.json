        "COSMETOLOGY_CONNECTION": "Identifying your multi-use items correctly is key to both safety and profitability. These are the workhorses of your kit, and knowing how to properly care for them is a fundamental skill for any licensed professional.",
        "THE_LAW": "The law defines multi-use items as being made of a hard, non-porous material that can be cleaned and disinfected. This includes materials like stainless steel, glass, and hard plastics. If it's not porous, it's potentially a keeper."
