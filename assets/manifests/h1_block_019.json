        "SCENARIO": "You've seen those cool UV light cabinets in some salons, often with a blue light glowing. They look futuristic and sanitary, but what exactly are they for? Are they sterilizers, disinfectants, or something else entirely?",
        "COSMETOLOGY_CONNECTION": "Understanding the *actual* purpose of a UV light box is crucial to avoiding a common and serious violation. These devices have a role, but it's not what many professionals might think.",
        "THE_LAW": "The law defines a 'Sanitizer' as a product or device that reduces the number of microorganisms to a safe level. While UV light *can* kill some germs, a 'UV light box' in a salon is legally considered only a storage unit for *already cleaned and disinfected* implements, not a primary method of disinfection or sterilization itself."
