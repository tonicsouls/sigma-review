        "SCENARIO": "We've talked about the keepers. Now let's talk about the disposables. These are the items you use once and then say goodbye. What makes an item single-use?",
        "COSMETOLOGY_CONNECTION": "Knowing what to throw away is just as important as knowing what to keep. This protects every single client from cross-contamination and is a bright, clear line you can never cross.",
        "THE_LAW": "The law defines single-use items as porous materials (like wood, paper, and cotton products) that absorb liquids and *cannot* be properly cleaned, disinfected, or sterilized. This includes items such as tissues, orangewood sticks, cotton balls, thread, surgical tape, extension pads, and gauze. The rule is simple: use it once, then toss it."
