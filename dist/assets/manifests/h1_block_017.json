        "SCENARIO": "Your autoclave is running every day, but how do you know it's actually reaching the right temperature and pressure to sterilize? You can't just trust the lights on the machine. You have to prove it.",

        "THE_LAW": "The law requires that autoclaves and dry heat sterilizers be tested for functionality on a regular basis. This is done using 'spore strips' which contain harmless but highly resistant bacterial spores. After a cycle, the strip is sent to a lab to verify that the spores were destroyed."
