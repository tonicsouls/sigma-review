        "SCENARIO": "Before every client, you know it's critical to clean your hands. But which is the best method for reducing germs and staying compliant: good old soap and water, or a quick pump of hand sanitizer?",

        "THE_LAW": "The law emphasizes vigorous hand washing with soap and water as the primary method for cleansing hands before and after serving each client. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers (with at least 60% alcohol) are permitted as a supplementary measure when hand washing facilities are unavailable or for quick refreshes, but they do not replace washing with visible soil present."
